The objective of the app is to allow users to identify the optimum salary that they could expect to achieve in salary negotiations.  We use actual salary, high end expected salary and associated probability, low end expected salary and associated probability as inputs.
The server function then applies a growth logistic function to those inputs to come up with a prediction 
 The app is at proof of concept stage and will need a substantial amount of further development, testing and bug fixing before it can be deployed.
